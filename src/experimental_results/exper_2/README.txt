I am trying to move to a bigger more appropriate res-net, with momentum optimzier. But things are working REALLY slowly.
I am struggling to get run-times that do not suck. I am played with different paramters changing here, but nothing is
working really well yet.

I am moving to a simplified version of this code without the multi-processing to see if I can figure out how to improve
run-times.
